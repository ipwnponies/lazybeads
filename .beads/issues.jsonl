{"id":"lazybeads-4tz","title":"Add panel titles embedded in borders (lazygit style)","description":"## Overview\nImplement panel titles that are embedded/nested within the top border of each panel, similar to how lazygit displays panel titles. The title should appear as part of the border line itself, not inside the panel content.\n\n## Visual Goal\n```\n╭─ In Progress ─────────────────╮\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nInstead of:\n```\n╭───────────────────────────────╮\n│ In Progress                   │\n│ BEADS-001 Fix login bug       │\n│ BEADS-003 Add dark mode       │\n╰───────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\n## Research Findings\n\n### Lipgloss Native Support (Coming Soon)\nThere are two open PRs in the lipgloss repository to add this:\n\n1. **PR #384** - `BorderDecoration` API with positioning:\n   ```go\n   style.BorderDecoration(lipgloss.NewBorderDecoration(\n       lipgloss.Top, lipgloss.Center,\n       titleStyle.Render(\"TITLE\"),\n   ))\n   ```\n\n2. **PR #463** - Simpler `BorderTitle(title string)` API\n\n### Current Workaround Options\n\n#### Option A: Manual Border Construction\nBuild the top border manually by combining border characters with the title:\n```go\nfunc renderPanelWithTitle(title, content string, width int, focused bool) string {\n    borderStyle := \"─\"\n    corner := \"╭\"\n    rightCorner := \"╮\"\n    \n    // Build: ╭─ Title ─────────╮\n    titlePart := fmt.Sprintf(\" %s \", title)\n    remainingWidth := width - len(titlePart) - 2 // -2 for corners\n    topBorder := corner + borderStyle + titlePart + strings.Repeat(borderStyle, remainingWidth) + rightCorner\n    \n    // Render content with side borders only\n    // Add bottom border\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Option B: Custom Border Definition\nCreate a custom border where the top row includes the title:\n```go\nfunc titleBorder(title string, width int) lipgloss.Border {\n    topLine := \"─ \" + title + \" \" + strings.Repeat(\"─\", width-len(title)-4)\n    return lipgloss.Border{\n        Top: topLine,\n        Bottom: \"─\",\n        Left: \"│\",\n        Right: \"│\",\n        TopLeft: \"╭\",\n        TopRight: \"╮\",\n        BottomLeft: \"╰\",\n        BottomRight: \"╯\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option C: Overlay Approach\nRender the panel with border, then overlay the title on the top border using ANSI positioning (more complex, not recommended).\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Check Lipgloss Version\nFirst check if `BorderTitle` or `BorderDecoration` is available in the current lipgloss version. If so, use native support.\n\n### 2. If Not Available - Manual Construction\nCreate a helper function in `internal/ui/styles.go`:\n```go\n// RenderPanelWithTitle renders content with a titled border\nfunc RenderPanelWithTitle(title, content string, width, height int, focused bool) string {\n    // Select border color based on focus\n    borderColor := ColorBorder\n    if focused {\n        borderColor = ColorPrimary\n    }\n    \n    // Build top border with embedded title\n    // Build side borders around content\n    // Build bottom border\n    // Return composed string\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Update Panel Rendering\nIn `internal/app/app.go`, update panel View() methods to use the new helper:\n```go\nfunc (p PanelModel) View() string {\n    content := p.renderTasks()\n    return ui.RenderPanelWithTitle(p.title, content, p.width, p.height, p.focused)\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Handle Dynamic Width\nThe title should truncate gracefully if the panel is too narrow:\n- Full title if it fits\n- Truncated with \"...\" if too long\n- No title if extremely narrow\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be implemented after BEADS-XXX (3-panel refactor) since that establishes the panel structure\n\n## Reference\n- [Lipgloss PR #384 - BorderDecoration](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/pull/384)\n- [Lipgloss PR #463 - BorderTitle](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss/pull/463)\n- lazygit uses configurable border styles following neovim's convention\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Each panel displays its title embedded in the top border\n- [ ] Title styling matches lazygit aesthetic\n- [ ] Focused panel title is highlighted (different color)\n- [ ] Titles truncate gracefully on narrow terminals\n- [ ] Works with rounded border style","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:47.021335-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:31:43.138219-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:31:43.138219-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented embedded panel titles in borders (lazygit style)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"lazybeads-4tz","depends_on_id":"lazybeads-9as","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:53.868657-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz"}]}

{"id":"lazybeads-9as","title":"Refactor to 3 vertically stacked panels (In Progress, Open, Closed)","description":"## Overview\nRework the lazybeads TUI to display 3 vertically stacked panels on the left side (similar to lazygit's layout):\n1. **In Progress** panel (top) - Tasks with status `in_progress`\n2. **Open** panel (middle) - Tasks with status `open` \n3. **Closed** panel (bottom) - Tasks with status `closed`\n\n## Current Architecture\n- **Main file**: `internal/app/app.go` (~989 lines)\n- **Styles**: `internal/ui/styles.go`\n- **Keys**: `internal/ui/keys.go`\n- Uses modal-based navigation with `ViewMode` states (ViewList, ViewDetail, ViewForm, etc.)\n- Current h/l keys cycle through filter modes: `FilterOpen → FilterReady → FilterClosed → FilterAll`\n- Width-dependent layout: side-by-side panels on wide screens (≥80 chars)\n\n## Required Changes\n\n### 1. Create Panel Component Model\nExtract a reusable panel component that can:\n- Display a filtered list of tasks\n- Track its own selection state\n- Handle focus state (focused vs unfocused styling)\n- Render with appropriate height allocation\n\n### 2. Update Main Model Structure\n```go\ntype Model struct {\n    // Replace single list with 3 panels\n    inProgressPanel  PanelModel\n    openPanel        PanelModel  \n    closedPanel      PanelModel\n    focusedPanel     int // 0=inProgress, 1=open, 2=closed\n    \n    // Keep existing\n    detail           viewport.Model\n    tasks            []models.Task\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Implement Focus Cycling\n- h/l (or ←/→) should cycle focus between the 3 panels\n- j/k should navigate within the focused panel\n- Enter should show details for selected task in focused panel\n- Visual indication of which panel has focus (use `FocusedPanelStyle` vs `PanelStyle`)\n\n### 4. Update Layout Logic\n- Divide available height into 3 sections (can be equal thirds or proportional)\n- Stack panels vertically using `lipgloss.JoinVertical`\n- Detail panel remains on the right side (when in wide mode)\n\n### 5. Update View Rendering\n```go\nfunc (m Model) viewMain() string {\n    // Stack 3 panels vertically\n    leftColumn := lipgloss.JoinVertical(lipgloss.Left,\n        m.inProgressPanel.View(),\n        m.openPanel.View(),\n        m.closedPanel.View(),\n    )\n    \n    // Join with detail panel if in wide mode\n    if m.width \u003e= 80 {\n        return lipgloss.JoinHorizontal(lipgloss.Top,\n            leftColumn,\n            m.viewDetail(),\n        )\n    }\n    return leftColumn\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Update Task Distribution\nWhen tasks load or refresh, distribute them to the appropriate panels:\n```go\nfunc (m *Model) distributeTasks() {\n    var inProgress, open, closed []models.Task\n    for _, t := range m.tasks {\n        switch t.Status {\n        case \"in_progress\":\n            inProgress = append(inProgress, t)\n        case \"open\":\n            open = append(open, t)\n        case \"closed\":\n            closed = append(closed, t)\n        }\n    }\n    m.inProgressPanel.SetTasks(inProgress)\n    m.openPanel.SetTasks(open)\n    m.closedPanel.SetTasks(closed)\n}\n```\n\n## Key Files to Modify\n- `internal/app/app.go` - Main refactor target\n- `internal/ui/styles.go` - Add multi-panel layout styles\n- `internal/ui/keys.go` - Update keybindings for panel focus\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 3 panels stack vertically on the left\n- [ ] Each panel shows tasks filtered by status\n- [ ] h/l cycles focus between panels (visual feedback)\n- [ ] j/k navigates within focused panel\n- [ ] Enter shows details for selected task\n- [ ] Detail panel shows on right side in wide mode\n- [ ] All existing actions (add, edit, close, delete) work on focused panel's selection","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-07T13:24:46.773248-08:00","created_by":"jeremy.saenz","updated_at":"2026-01-07T13:29:57.877293-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T13:29:57.877293-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented 3 vertically stacked panels (In Progress, Open, Closed) with h/l to cycle focus between panels"}
